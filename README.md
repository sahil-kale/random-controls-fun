# Random Controls Fun

This repository is a collection of control systems experiments and simulations I've played around with—usually for fun, learning, or out of random curiosity. Some of the scripts use [TCLab](https://apmonitor.com/heat.htm), others are purely simulations or concept demos.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repo is **not** meant to showcase good software engineering practices. It's a sandbox for quick ideas, test scripts, and algorithms I'm exploring. If you're looking for clean code or structured libraries, check out my other repositories instead.

That said, I like keeping this public in case others find the work interesting or want to see how a particular method was implemented. You're welcome to follow along as I dive deeper into the world of control systems.

**Note:** Portions of the code may be AI-assisted or adapted from other sources, especially for prototyping or experimentation.
